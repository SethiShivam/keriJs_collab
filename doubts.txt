Plan for events? 

Within the KERI protocol cryptographic digests and signatures are created of specified subsets of the data elements
 extracted from complete KERI key events.
  Consequently these extracted data sets also need to be serialized.
   Importantly, however, the extracted data set serialization do not need to be propagated over the network.
    This means that the serializations do not need to preserve the semantic structure of the data.
     This allows extracted data serialization encoding to simplified.
      These digests of extracted data, however, need to be reproducible by any other entity. 
This means that the ordering of the data elements in the serialization must be exactly specified.


the extracted data set serialization do not need to be propagated over the network 

i am not fully able to understand this .
as per my understanding we are extractng this subset of data from the main event logs.
and we are extracting it 

why are we serializing this data  ?

isn't  this data is already serialized
